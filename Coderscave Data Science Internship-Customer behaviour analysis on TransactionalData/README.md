# Analyzing Customer Behavior Based on Transaction Data
This project focuses on understanding and analyzing customer behavior using transactional data. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive valuable insights into customer preferences, purchasing patterns, and overall behavior.
## Key Objectives
1. **Understand Customer Preferences:** Identify the most popular products or services among customers.
2. **Analyze Purchasing Patterns:** Explore trends in customer purchasing behavior over time.
3. **Segment Customers:** Use clustering techniques to group customers based on their transactional behavior.

## Techniques Used
- **Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   Summary statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Clustering algorithms such as K-means clustering.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Machine learning algorithms like Random Forest Classifier for predicting customer churn.
## Insights Derived 
1. Product Preferences: Finding the high selling products or services.
2. Seasonal Trends: Analysis of purchase patterns during specific seasons or in a certain period of time by the customers.
3. Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on their transactional behavior.

## Python Libraries Used

The project was implemented using Python and several Python libraries,

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Scikit-learn


## Conclusion
This project has successfully dive into the realm of customer behavior analysis through thorough examination of transactional data. By using powerful analytical tools and techniques, we have gathered valuable insights into customer preferences, purchasing patterns, and segmentation. These findings not only shed light on the dynamics of customer interactions but also provides a pathway for businesses to refine their strategies, enhance customer experiences, and drive sustainable growth.
